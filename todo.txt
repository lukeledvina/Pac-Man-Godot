Pac-Man Clone

Try to design it in such a way that makes the UI + game responsive and scale well

Grid Movement
Score System
Different Enemy AIs, all inheriting from a base enemy
Power-Ups
Level Completion


To implement:
	Pellets
	Super Pellets
	Ghosts
	
	Main Menu
		Play
		High Scores
		Options
	
	Controller Support / Remappable controls ( both really useful to learn for future )
	
	Sound Effects
	Music (try making it yourself in FL Studio...)
