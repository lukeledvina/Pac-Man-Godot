Pac-Man Clone

Try to design it in such a way that makes the UI + game responsive and scale well

Grid Movement
Score System
Different Enemy AIs, all inheriting from a base enemy
Power-Ups
Level Completion


To implement:
	Ghosts
	Super Pellets

	Lives System
	
		
	Shader to Remove black from sprites and replace w/ transparency
	
	Save system to save high scores
	
	Controller Support / Remappable controls ( both really useful to learn for future )
	
	Sound Effects
	Music (try making it yourself in FL Studio...)
